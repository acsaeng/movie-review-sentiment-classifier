# Sentiment Classification of IMDb Movie Reviews

**Authors:** Timothy Mok, Aron Saengchan, and Jimmy Zhu

## Summary

Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed within a piece of text in order to determine the overall opinion towards a particular topic. It involves the contextual mining of text and the ability to extract an intended meaning from it. It incorporates both natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques in order to classify documents into a predefined set of categories. Sentiment analysis has proven to benefit a wide range of applications for various analytics, some of which include product reviews, business intelligence, recommender systems, and message filtering.

The focus of this study was to extend and improve upon the research conducted Pang et al. [1] on the sentiment classification of IMDb movies reviews. As opposed to topical-based categorization which attempts to classify text based on subject matter, sentiment classification aims to classify a document based on the overall opinion towards a subject. This form of classification has the potential to enhance the analysis of free form survey responses given in natural language format, provided that the meaning behind a text can be successfully extracted and interpreted.

In order to improve upon the previous work, different methods in the natural language processing and machine learning algorithms will be applied to IMDb movie review data. The textual data used in this project involve a combination of the original dataset collected in the original study, as well as a new dataset acquired by the group. A set of preprocessing techniques were selected and applied to data in order to prepare it for machine learning analysis. In addition to the best model used in the previous study, a set of three new machine learning models were employed for this project. Each model underwent rigorous tuning and optimization in order to obtain the best outcome and the results were compared using various performance metrics to determine if the sentiment analysis was improved upon.
